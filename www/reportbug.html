<H1>How to Write a Good Bug Report? 

</H1>

<P>To increase the chances that the bug you're reporting will be

addressed in a timely manner, you should adhere to the following

guidelines: 

</P>

<OL>

	<LI><P>When you encounter a behavior which might potentially be a

	bug, try to collect as much relevant data as possible (e.g. take a

	screenshot in case of a UI problem, generate a thread-dump in case

	of a deadlock or serious performance degradation, create copies of

	relevant files, etc.) and try to recall and note the actions you

	performed right before the problem occurred.</P>

	<LI><P>Try to restore the original state (if possible) and reproduce

	the incorrect behavior using the steps you noted. This should help

	you to determine whether the problem is reproducible and persistent

	or just intermittent. This is not to say intermittent problems

	shouldn't be reported, but it's always worth pointing it out in the

	bug report to make the evaluators aware of this fact.</P>

	<LI><P>There is a chance that someone already reported the bug

	you've just encountered. Therefore, it's a good idea to search the

	bug database first. Go to the the JDIC Issue Tracking page, fill-in

	the query parameters that seem relevant to your case, submit the

	form, and go through the returned list of issues to see if any of

	them match your problem. Typically, you'll want to search for issues

	of type <I>DEFECT</I>, in an open state (<I>NEW</I>, <I>STARTED</I>,

	<I>REOPENED</I>) with a specific string in the <B>Summary</B> and/or

	<B>Description</B> fields. If the bug already exists in the database

	and you still think you have some useful info to share, it is highly

	recommended to add this info to the existing issue instead of filing

	a new one.</P>

	<LI><P>If you assume the bug hasn't been reported yet, it's time to

	enter a new bug. (Note: to be able to do so and to be able to

	add/update information in the issue database, you need to have a

	netbeans.org account and be logged in. If you don't have an account

	yet, you'll have to <A HREF="http://www.dev.java.net/servlets/Join">register</A>

	and then become a member of the JDIC project.).</P>

	<UL>

		<LI><P>The first thing you need to do is to select the <B>Component</B>

		to file the bug against. 

		</P>

		<LI><P>After selecting the component, you'll be prompted to fill in

		the following fields:</P>

		<UL>

			<LI><P><B>Version</B> - choose the version of the component in

			which you encountered the problem. In case of a problem found in a

			development build, select the next release version number, or

			<I>current</I>.</P>

			<LI><P><B>Subcomponent</B> - select the subcomponent of a given

			component. If you're not sure, just select <I>code</I>.</P>

			<LI><P><B>Platform</B> - select the platform you were using when

			the problem occured. If you were able to reproduce it on multiple

			platforms, or are positively sure the behavior is platform

			independent, use <I>All</I>.</P>

			<LI><P><B>OS</B> - similar to the <B>Platform.</B></P>

			<LI><P><B>Priority</B> - use this field to indicate the urgency

			and severity of the issue. Refer to <A HREF="bug_priority_guidelines.html">Bug

			Priority Guidelines</A> for instructions how to set the priority

			level appropriately. If you're still in doubt, it's better to

			stick with the default P3 value.</P>

			<LI><P><B>Issue Type</B> - select the type of issue you're

			reporting. In most cases, you'll probably want to use <I>DEFECT</I>

			(when reporting a bug) or <I>ENHANCEMENT</I> (when requesting an

			enhancement or feature).</P>

			<LI><P><B>Assigned To</B> - unless you're absolutely sure who this

			issue should be assigned to, leave this field blank. The bug will

			be automatically assigned to the component (subcomponent) owner.</P>

			<LI><P><B>Cc</B> - enter an optional comma-separated list of email

			aliases you want to be notified about this issue and any

			subsequent changes to its status. You as the reporter will be

			notified automatically, so there's no need to add yourself. The

			aliases must refer to valid netbeans.org accounts (e.g.

			<I>jdoe@netbeans.org</I>). Arbitrary email addresses are not

			accepted by the system.</P>

			<LI><P><B>URL</B> - if there is a URL relevant to this issue, you

			can type it here. In most cases, this field will be blank.</P>

			<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>Summary</B> - a brief (one

			sentence) description of the issue. You should try to make it as

			specific as possible while keeping it short (70 characters at the

			most). 

			</P>

			<LI><P><B>Description</B> - a detailed description of the problem.

			The description should include the following information:</P>

			<UL>

				<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the build number 

				</P>

				<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">JDK version 

				</P>

				<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">observed behavior 

				</P>

				<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">expected behavior 

				</P>

				<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">exact steps to reproduce the

				problem 

				</P>

				<LI><P>any other information potentially related to the issue 

				</P>

			</UL>

			<P>Please note that you should not paste larger chunks of text

			(e.g. complete exception logs and thread dumps, source files, test

			data, etc.) into the Description field. You should always provide

			those files in the form of attachments (see below). There is one

			exception to this rule: although including complete exception logs

			in Description is not recommended, it is a good idea to copy the

			relevant part of the stack trace (usually 4-6 top lines to the

			field to allow for easy searching.</P>

		</UL>

		<LI><P>After completing the form, push the <B>Commit</B> button to

		send it to the database. As a confirmation you will see a number

		uniquely identifying the issue you've just filed.</P>

		<LI><P>If you have some additional files relevant to the issue,

		click on the <B>Add Attachment</B> link in the page you get after

		the previous step. You'll be asked to provide the following info:</P>

		<UL>

			<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the location of file to be

			sumbitted on your local machine 

			</P>

			<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">a one-line description of the

			attachment 

			</P>

			<LI><P>the type of file being attached (plain text, diff, HTML,

			GIF, JPEG, PNG, binary) 

			</P>

		</UL>

		<P>Push the <B>Submit</B> button to attach the file to the issue

		report.</P>

	</UL>

	<LI><P>Should you have any questions or comments regarding the issue

	handling process, please contact the JDIC <A HREF="mailto:issues@jdic.dev.java.net">issues</A>

	mailing list..</P>
