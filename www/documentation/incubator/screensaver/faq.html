<h3>General</h3>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Q.</span> What is SaverBeans?<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A.</span> <a href="https://jdic.dev.java.net/documentation/incubator/screensaver/">SaverBeans</a> is a collection of platform independent screensavers and a set of tools to help developers build them.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Q.</span> What is the SaverBeans SDK?<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A.</span> It is a software development kit for developing platform-independent screensavers, and it is part of the <a href="http://jdic.dev.java.net/">JDIC</a> project.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Q. </span>What is JDIC?<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">A.</span> <a href="http://jdic.dev.java.net/">JDIC</a> is short for JDesktop Integration Components.&nbsp; It "aims to make Java technology-based 
  applications ("Java applications") first-class citizens of current 
  desktop platforms without sacrificing platform independence."<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Q.</span> What is the SaverBeans Screensaver Pack?<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A.</span> It is a collection of community-contributed screensavers built with the SaverBeans SDK.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Q.</span> Where can I download the SaverBeans SDK and SaverBeans Screensaver Pack?<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A.</span> Click to download the <a href="https://jdic.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=1330&amp;expandFolder=1330&amp;folderID=0">SaverBeans SDK</a> and <a href="https://screensavers.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList">SaverBeans Screensaver Pack</a>.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Q.</span> How stable is the SaverBeans SDK?<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A.</span> The SaverBeans SDK is
currently an early access release and is likely to have a number of
bugs.&nbsp; We've tested it on various flavors of Windows and Unix and
have had success, but true stability won't come until more people use
it and report bugs.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Q.</span> I've written a screensaver.&nbsp; Where can I submit it?<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A.</span> Go to the <a href="http://screensavers.dev.java.net/">screensavers</a> project and follow the instructions there.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Q. </span>I've found a bug in a screensaver or the SaverBeans SDK.&nbsp; Where do I report it?<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A.</span> If the bug is in a particular screensaver, report it <a href="https://screensavers.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectIssues">here</a>.&nbsp; If you are sure the bug is in the SDK itself (e.g. incorrect code generated for a particular platform), report it <a href="https://jdic.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectIssues">here</a>.&nbsp; If you're not sure, use the first link.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Q. </span>What forums are available?<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A.</span> There is a <a href="https://screensavers.dev.java.net/servlets/ForumMessageList?forumID=698">general screensavers discussion forum</a> for screensavers developed using the SDK.<br>
<br>
<h3>Installing Screensavers</h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">
Q.</span> How do I install a SaverBeans screensaver on Windows?<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A.</span> First, <a href="https://screensavers.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList">download the screensaver</a>.&nbsp;
For Windows, you should only download the files that end in
-win32.zip.&nbsp; Then, copy all the files in the .zip (except
README.txt) to your Windows system directory (usually
C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32).&nbsp; That should do the trick.&nbsp; See the
README.txt file that came with the screensaver for more details.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Q. </span>How do I install a SaverBeans screensaver on Unix (Linux, Solaris, JDS, etc.)?<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A.</span> First, <a href="https://screensavers.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList">download the screensaver</a>.&nbsp;
For Unix, you should only download the files that end in
-unix.zip.&nbsp; Then, follow the instructions in the README.txt.&nbsp;
You will have to copy files to various places in your system to install
the screensaver.<br>
<br>
<h3>Running Screensavers</h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">
Q.</span> I tried to run the 'blackglass' screensaver but the screen looks like it's chopped in half.&nbsp; What happened?<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A.</span> This is how it's supposed to look - let it run for a little while
and the effect will become clear.&nbsp; The beans at the top of the
screen are going in a circle that's bigger than the screen and the
beans on the bottom of the screen are simply a reflection.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Q.</span> Is it possible to change whcih Java Virtual Machine (JVM) the screensaver will use?<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A.</span> On Unix, the virtual machine
is automatically detected using the steps outlined in the README.&nbsp;
If this automatic detection fails, you can override it by passing <code>-jdkhome</code> to the screensaver.&nbsp; On Windows, the screensaver will use the "<code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\JavaSoft\Java Runtime Environment\JavaHome</code>" registry setting to determine which JVM to use.&nbsp; This is automatically set by the JVM installer.<br>
