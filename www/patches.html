<H1><A NAME="patches"></A>Contributing Patches</H1>

<P>Well-described, easy-to-apply patches are a pleasure for a developer to receive 
  and go a long way towards making the JDIC more stable and powerful, so thank 
  you in advance for contributing them! </P>

<P><b>Making and applying a patch</b></P>

<P>First, make sure you are making changes in the most recent version of the sources. 
  For this, it is best to use CVS to check out the source (usually on the CVS 
  trunk; sometimes the most active release branch - ask if unsure), make your 
  modifications (but do not check them in), and then run (example for Unix, other 
  operating systems similar):</P>

<PRE>$ cd /sources/javadesktop

$ ls

shows jdic

$ cvs update jdic<i> ...or wherever your changes are; may be &gt;1 module</i>

make sure you are working against current sources

$ cvs diff jdic

sanity-check the change

$ cvs -f diff -u -N jdic &gt; /tmp/my-patch.diff

sanity-check the patch</PRE><P>

If you are adding or modifying binary files, it is best to attach the

new or modified binary files separately and exclude them from the

textual patch.</P>

<P>Common patch mistakes include:</P>

<OL>

	<LI><P>Forgetting <CODE>-u</CODE>. Default-format diffs show no

	context and will be <EM>hard to read and apply</EM>, especially if

	they were made against somewhat out-of-date sources. <CODE>-c</CODE>

	is also OK but <CODE>-u</CODE> is most common.</P>

	<LI><P>Forgetting about new (added) files. Run <CODE>cvs add</CODE>

	(but do not commit!) to make sure CVS thinks of them as added as

	part of the patch, and remember <CODE>-N</CODE> which includes them

	in the patch. Also run <CODE>cvsremove</CODE> (but do not commit)

	when a patch should delete some files.</P>

	<LI><P>Using other switches such as <CODE>-t</CODE> which can make

	the patch difficult to apply.</P>

	<LI><P>Starting from the wrong directory. <EM>Always</EM> make

	patches from the root of the source tree to avoid confusion.</P>

	<LI><P>Manually editing patches. You may be tempted to concatenate

	patches, or manually edit them to exclude things you do not really

	want to submit. <EM>Do not do this.</EM> The patch may be corrupted

	as a result. Fix your sources to reflect what you want the result to

	be, and run a fresh diff. Include all affected files in the diff

	command, even if they are in different modules.</P>

	<LI><P>Including extraneous changes. Look over your patch to make

	sure every change relates to the fix you are making, and is

	necessary. Remember other people will read your patch before

	applying it! Do not make gratuitous whitespace changes. Do not

	reformat existing code you are not modifying.</P>

	<LI><P>Using the plain diff command. Use <CODE>cvs diff</CODE> to

	ensure that exact information about repository path and original

	version of the patched files is retained.</P>

	<LI><P>Using old sources. Patches made against obsolete sources may

	be hard to use. Make sure you are using recent versions of all

	source file (<CODE>cvs&nbsp;update</CODE> first). If you must submit

	several patches against the same files, be sure to indicate if they

	must be applied in some particular order.</P>

</OL>

<P>A properly made patch is easy to apply by someone with commit

access who has reviewed it. Use of the Unix <CODE>patch</CODE> tool

is recommended; Windows users should be able to get it from the

Cygwin tools distribution.</P>

<PRE>save patch to disk, say /tmp/suggested-patch.diff

$ cd /sources/javadesktop

$ patch -p0 --dry-run &lt; /tmp/suggested-patch.diff

make sure no errors are reported - this just tests the patch format

$ patch -p0 &lt; /tmp/suggested-patch.diff

$ cvs diff jdic/ or whatever part of sources are affected

sanity-check diff, compare to patch (should be same or similar)

test, do a build, commit as usual</PRE><P>

If the &quot;dry run&quot; fails, you may need to use additional

options to <CODE>patch</CODE>, or at worst just apply the patch

manually. Do not forget to sanity-check file additions and removals!

You probably need to use <CODE>cvs add</CODE> and <CODE>cvsremove</CODE>

to complete these.</P>

<P><b>Making a patch available and accepting it</b></P>

<P>The best way to submit a patch is through Issue Tracking. In some

cases you could send it as a MIME attachment to the proper <A HREF="mailinglists.html">mailing

list</A> if it is a short patch and you are more expecting it to

looked at for comments than applied as is. But usually patches ought

to be put in Issue Tracking.</P>

<P>First, if an issue describing the problem (or feature) you are

trying to solve already exists, use it. If it does not, create an

issue, and mark it to be of type <CODE>PATCH</CODE>. The issue should

include at least the following:</P>

<UL>

	<LI><P>The patch file itself, of course - as an Issue Tracking

	attachment, <EM>not</EM> pasted into the <B>Description</B> field.

	(Line-wrapped or reformatted patches are not usable. They must be

	exactly as produced by <CODE>cvs diff</CODE>.)</P>

	<LI><P>A description of what problem you are trying to fix, if

	possible with steps to reproduce it.</P>

	<LI><P>A description of what the behavior should be with the patch

	in place. Ideally also steps to demonstrate that the patch fixes the

	described problem.</P>

	<LI><P>If reasonable, a description of how the patch works.</P>

	<LI><P>If a significant amount of code is involved, it is safest to

	mention in the issue comments that you agree to let the patch be

	used under the project's license as part of the JDIC component's

	code. If you are adding new source files, they must be marked with

	the project's license notice or the patch cannot be accepted.</P>

	<LI>
    <P>If this is your first code submission to JDIC , you must fill in a Joint 
      Copyright Assignment - see <A HREF="resource/JDIC_JCA.pdf">the JCA Policy</A> 
      page for more info.</P>

	<LI><P>The patch submitter should be either the submitter of the

	issue, or add him or herself to the CC list of the issue (format:

	<CODE><I>loginname</I></CODE>). This ensures that the submitter will

	see any comments or changes made to the issue and be able to respond

	if needed.</P>

</UL>

<P>The developer responsible for the section of code affected should either apply 
  the patch and mark the issue <CODE>FIXED</CODE>; or add a comment with an objection 
  if the patch does not seem safe, does not appear to fix the problem, or there 
  is not really a problem to begin with. Developers must also confirm that the 
  contributor has filled in and submitted a JCA before commiting their patch - 
  see <A HREF="resource/JDIC_JCA.pdf">the JCA Policy</A> page for more info.</P>

<P>Notifications of any changes to Issue Tracking, as well as CVS

checkins, are automatically sent to the appropriate bug and CVS

mailing lists, so you can monitor if the patch has really been

applied. Make sure you subscribe to at least the CVS and bug mailing

lists for the module you are working on - see the <A HREF="mailinglists.html">mailing

lists</A> page for details.</P>

<P>Of course, if you do not know exactly how to fix a problem, but

have an idea that it is being caused by a certain section of code

somehow, you can just mention what you know on the developer list and

maybe someone else will know how to fix it. And please <A HREF="issues.html">report

a bug</A> about it so it does not get lost.</P>
