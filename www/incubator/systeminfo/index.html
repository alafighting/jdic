<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
Integration with the user desktop is increasingly important as the line
between desktop environment and application environment blurs. The SystemInfo
package allows you to query the desktop environment for information such as
user idle time and if the user's session is locked.
</p>

<p>
Since desktop environment implementation varies from operating system to
operating system (and even from release to release), release targets may move
a bit. Currently we're working on support for Windows 98/NT4,
Windows 2000/XP, *nix variants running XWindows and Solaris.
</p>

<p>
The CVS module for the SystemInfo source code in the CVS repository is: 
<code>[jdic]/src/incubator/systeminfo</code>. You can find instructions for 
checking out the source code 
<a href="https://jdic.dev.java.net/source/browse/jdic/">here</a>. 

<p>
Some quickstart instructions on how to build SystemInfo .dll's in Windows (using
the lovely <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW project</a>) are 
<a href="docs/MinGW%20Instructions.pdf">available in PDF format</a>.

<p>
Binary releases and JavaDoc info is forthcoming.
