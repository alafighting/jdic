<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
Integration with the user desktop is increasingly important as the line
between desktop environment and application environment blurs. The SystemInfo
package allows you to query the desktop environment for information such as
user idle time and if the user's session is locked.
</p>

<p>
Since desktop environment implementation varies from operating system to
operating system (and even from release to release), release targets may move
a bit. Currently we're working on support for Windows 98/NT4,
Windows 2000/XP, *nix variants running XWindows and Solaris.
</p>

<h3>Building from CVS</h3>
<p>
The CVS module for the SystemInfo source code in the CVS repository is: 
<code>[jdic]/src/incubator/systeminfo</code>. You can find instructions for 
checking out the source code 
<a href="https://jdic.dev.java.net/source/browse/jdic/">here</a>. 

<p>
Some quickstart instructions on how to build SystemInfo .dll's in Windows (using
the lovely <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW project</a>) are 
<a href="docs/MinGW%20Instructions.pdf">available in PDF format</a>.

<h3>Current Status</h3>
<p>
<code>5/27/2005</code>
<br>
Currently we're working on getting session lock detection to work from X11 window
managers, which is harder than it first sounded. Looking at source from projects
such as xscreensaver and xlock, basically the locking happens by intercepting
all incoming mouse/keyboard/input events and sending 'em directly to the application's
event manager. Which essentially means that our attempts to "hear" a lock call
gets flushed down the proverbial pipe. If you have a good idea or code to contribute,
