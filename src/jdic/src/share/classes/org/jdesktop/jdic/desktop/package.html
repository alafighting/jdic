<p>Though J2SE offers some desktop integration features, Java application don't    
fully behave like native apps and couldn't access all the common desktop    
services. This package provides API to launch native applications, including    
the document viewer applications, the    
system browser and the system mailer, and to make use of the printer facility to 
print a document.</p>
