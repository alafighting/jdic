<h1>Contributing to the JDIC Project</h1>
<p>The JDIC source code is available to anyone to reuse according to
the the license. Development of JDIC happens in public and is open to
individuals and companies. Everyone benefits by having better software
when the fixes or enhancements are implemented.</p>
<p>Here are some of the ways you can contribute to JDIC:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><b>Participate on Forums and Mailing Lists</b> <br>
Through the JDIC <a href="mailinglists.html">forums and mailing lists</a>,
people using the software can benefit from each others' expertise. To
be really useful, the lists need <i>your</i> input! Please don't be
afraid to post — help out others when you can; post your questions,
comments, and ideas as you see fit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>File a Bug Report</b> <br>
Bug reports are very helpful to developers and a great way to
contribute to a project! Remember to take a little time when <a
 href="issues.html">filing a bug report</a> — make sure you can
reproduce the problem, and be very explicit in your description of the
problem. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>File an Enhancement Request</b> <br>
If there's something you'd like to see and don't, or something you can
imagine being improved, let us know by filing an enhancement request.
Use the project's Issue Tracking and file an "Enhancement" rather than
a "Defect".</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Contributing Code</b> <br>
As mentioned above, JDIC is open source — all of the source code is
available, and if there's a feature you'd like to see or a bug you'd
like to see fixed, you have the power to make that happen. See the
sections on <a href="patches.html">contributing patches</a> for more
information. </p>
